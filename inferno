 Halfway upon the journey of our life 1
I found myself within a forest dark, 2
For the straightforward pathway had been lost.

Ah me! how hard a thing it is to say
What was this forest savage, rough, and stern,
Which in the very thought renews the fear..

I cannot well repeat how there I entered,
So full was I of slumber at the moment
In which I had abandoned the true way. 

Nothing from before matters, because I have my Lovely girlfriend Irini
